# 14.33-policing-project
Code for my 14.33 semester research project that studies that effect of line-of-duty-deaths and police force size on arrests.

Repository contains 3 .ipynb files that implement generalized preparation of data with sample restrictions for use in stata; an initial analyses file that creates some histograms and drops some cities from consideration, along with balance tests to check the usefulness of the sample restriction; and a file that creates a new version of the dataset for use in matching-based approaches as an alternative to the initial sample restriction approach. There is a .do file with the stata code running the actual regressions, as well as a copy of the project paper that was submitted to and published in the UEA Journal, Volume XXIII.
